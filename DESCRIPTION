Description: LegATo is a suite of open-source software tools for
    longitudinal microbiome analysis. It is extendable to several
    different study forms with optimal ease-of-use for researchers.
    Microbiome time-series data presents distinct challenges including
    complex covariate dependencies and variety of longitudinal study
    designs. This toolkit will allow researchers to determine which
    microbial taxa are affected over time by perturbations such as onset
    of disease or lifestyle choices, and to predict the effects of these
    perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability
    of commensal bacteria.
